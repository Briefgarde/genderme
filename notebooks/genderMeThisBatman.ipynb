    "As I'm doing my Master Degree in Information Science, the main research project I'm working on deals with predicting the gender of a person given their name, and potentially their nationality. In this project, a colleague of mine and I aim to benchmark the most prominent tools and services available on the market to see which performs the best and in which circumstances, as well as examine if they show notable biais one way or another. Similar studies have already be done in the past, notably by Santamaría and Mihaljević, and we've thus focused the goal of this research on the geographical influence of the names and how they are handled by the tools. \n",

    "At the same time, I'm following the course on Machine Learning and Advanced Neural Net, which lets me discover the intricate inner workings of various model and how the algorithms that powers them works on a mathematical level. While positively fascinating and a lesson I'm always happy to go to, it lacks any direct practical applicate : we study the theory and the maths behind those models, not how to use any of this knowledge in real life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that my goal later is to enter the field of Data Science professionaly, I am thus aiming here to combine the two elements I've mentioned by working on my own (small scale) model of gender inference from names. As part of my research project, I already have access to a (decently curated) dataset of people with the name and gender of everyone, and I believe it is enough to make something that can be interesting.
